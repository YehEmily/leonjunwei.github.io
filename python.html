            If there is only one valid representation, the function should return it as a string, in the form MM/DD/YY. If there are multiple valid representations, the function should return the string "Ambiguous." Each of x, y, z will be between 1 to 99 inclusive. You may also assume that there are no leap years.

            <p style="font-size:16px">My function barely made it under the time limit! My submitted implementation used 'next(k for k in range(index:heights),200000)', but trinket doesn't support the usage of 'next' so I had to do a little adjustment.</p>

            <p style="font-size:16px"><i>
            To help Beta get into the room, write a method called answer(x), which outputs a list of strings representing where the weights should be placed, in order for the two sides to be balanced, assuming that weight on the left has mass x units.

            <p style="font-size:16px">I had to look up the algorithm for breaking up numbers into powers of three! Implementation for this was pretty straightforward once I had the method.</p>

            Rabbits are arranged in an n x n grid, where n is less than 50. The strength of each rabbit's immune system is represented by an integer, the virus can only spread upwards or downwards (not sideways), and the virus' virulence has to be equal to or larger than the rabbit's immune system in order to infect it. Given an initial grid of rabbits and their immune systems, return the end result (with all infected rabbits set to -1).
            </i></p>
            <p style="font-size:16px">I ran the infection checking for 100 steps, reasoning that it'd be enough time to infect all the necessary rabbits. There's probably a more efficient/elegant way to do it, though - a breadth-first search, perhaps?</p>
